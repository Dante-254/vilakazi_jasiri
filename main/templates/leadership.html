                        Our leadership structure is built on the principles of servant leadership and democratic 
                        decision-making. The Crew Council consists of elected members who represent the interests 
                        of all crew members and work together to plan activities and make important decisions.

                        The leadership team is responsible for organizing events, managing resources, and ensuring 
                        that all members have opportunities to grow and contribute to the crew's mission.
